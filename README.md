### Architecture 
It also works with a front-end and a back-end
- front-end runs on the client side
- back-end runs on the server side

**Client** searches a URL verby.be =>
Browser sends a request to the back-end server
Server sends a response via the HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)

And sends a HTML(HypertText Markup Language) or Data to the browser that generates HTML on the clients side

So that means that the client asks data from the back-end server via API(Application Programming Interface)
